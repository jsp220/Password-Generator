Password Generator exercise initially cloned from https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/friendly-parakeet

* declared two variables (passLength and charTypes) to store user input regarding password requirements
* created a library of characters (charLibrary) as an array so that certain sets of characters could be chosen to be included according to user input
* functions passwordPrompts, getPassLength, and getCharTypes allow the user to input the exact requirements needed for the password
* writePassword function generates the pseudo-random password according to the criteria that the user specifies and outputs it into the box on the page using querySelector
